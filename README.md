A collection of beginner to advance example programs and docs for seahorse-lang


## Introduction:
Developing on Solana is notoriously difficult with a significant roadblock being learning Rust. Anchor framework abstracted away a lot of complexities involved in building on Solana, however, learning Rust still remains a barrier for new devs looking to explore the Solana ecosystem. Enter seahorse lang, a framework for developing Solana programs in python, built using Anchor.

This is a simple guide to build a Solana application using seahorse lang. This guide is perfect for new devs aiming to learn Solana development.

## Overview:
Every new technology should be used to solve humanityâ€™s toughest problems. Hence we will use the Solana blockchain to build a program to find out which is the best flavour of peanut butter by letting users vote on their favourite flavour, crunchy or smooth.

## Prerequisites:
First let us install the command line tools required to build. We need <a href="https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools">Solana</a>, <a href="https://book.anchor-lang.com/introduction/introduction.html"> Anchor</a>, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS</a> and <a href="https://seahorse-lang.org/docs/installation">Seahorse</a>. The links provided contain the step-by-step guide on installing these tools and the dependencies required for them like Rust.

Once done, you should be able to run the following commands successfully:

solana --version<br/>
anchor --version<br/>
node --version<br/>
seahorse --version<br/>
